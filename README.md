# OCR<br><br>
Optical  character  Recognition  (OCR)  is  a  conversion  of scanned  or  printed  text  images,  
handwritten  text  into editable  text for  further  processing.  This technology  allows machine  to  
recognize  the  text  automatically. <br><br> In development of computerized OCR system, few problems can occur.  First:  there  
is  very  little  visible  difference  between some  letters  and  digits  for  computers  to  understand.  For 
example it might be difficult for the computer to differentiate between  digit  “0”  and  letter  “o”.  Second:  
It  might  be  very difficult  to  extract  text,  which  is  embedded  in  very  dark background or printed on 
other words or graphics. <br><br>There are many applications  of  OCR,  which  
includes:  License  plate recognition, image text extraction from natural scene  images, extracting text 
from scanned documents etc.
